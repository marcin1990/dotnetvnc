On a Pocket PC
==============
1) Install Pocket C#.
2) Put all source files in \pc#\proj\vncviewer.
3) Tap on either vncviewer.debug.csant (debug build) or vncviewer.release.csant (release build).
4) The build process should complete in one to two minutes.

On a Windows desktop
====================
1) Install .NET Framework SDK 1.1.
2) Execute C:\Program Files\Microsoft.NET\SDK\v1.1\Bin\sdkvars.bat. Replace the path with whatever appropriate.
3) Put all source files in a directory.
4) Open a command prompt.
5) CD to where you put the source files.
6) Execute csc /target:winexe /out:vncviewer.exe *.cs
7) The build process should complete in seconds.

On a Windows desktop (exe runs on both desktop and PPC)
=======================================================
If binary compatibility (i.e., the same exe runs on both desktop and PPC) is desired when building on desktop, follow the following steps:
1) Install .NET Framework SDK 1.1.
2) Copy the .NET Compact Framework DLLs to a directory on the desktop. You can obtain the DLLs from various sources. For example, you can copy the DLLs from a Pocket C# distribution or an installed .NET Compact Framework SDK. These files are:
	Microsoft.WindowsCE.Forms.dll
	mscorlib.dll
	System.Data.dll
	System.dll
	System.Drawing.dll
	System.Net.IrDA.dll
	System.Web.Services.dll
	System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid.dll
	System.Windows.Forms.dll
	System.Xml.dll
3) Execute C:\Program Files\Microsoft.NET\SDK\v1.1\Bin\sdkvars.bat. Replace the path with whatever appropriate.
4) Put all source files in a directory.
5) Open a command prompt.
6) CD to where you put the source files.
7) Execute the following line, replacing the path of the various DLLs accordingly:
	csc /target:winexe /out:vncviewer.exe /nostdlib /noconfig /reference:\pc#\netcf\System.dll;\pc#\netcf\mscorlib.dll;\pc#\netcf\System.Xml.dll;\pc#\netcf\System.Drawing.dll;\pc#\netcf\System.Windows.Forms.dll *.cs
8) The build process should complete in seconds.
